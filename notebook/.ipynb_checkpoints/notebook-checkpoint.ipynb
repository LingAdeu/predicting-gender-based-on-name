    "## **1 Introduction**\n",
    "Outside Social Sciences and Humanities, studies of names have shown growing attention in Computer Science. Some of these studies focus on building classifiers to predict gender based on the names in different population such as Indian (Tripathi & Faruqui, [2013](https://doi.org/10.1109/TECHSYM.2011.5783842)), Chinese (Jia & Zhao, [2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32236-6_62)), Vietnamese (Huong et al, [2022](https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6570228)), and Brazilian (Rego, Silva, [2021](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.10156)). In Indonesia, there have also been some attempts to develop similar predictive models comparing both conventional machine learning algorithms and neural networks (e.g., Rahmadi et al, [2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVEE59738.2023.10348281); Septiandri, [2017](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1707.07129)). In general, the evidence suggests that neural networks shows a great potential for name-based gender prediction tasks because of their higher performance over conventional ML models although the performance gaps are not very substantial, particularly for Indonesian names. These narrow gaps raise a question whether conventional ML algorithms can have higher performance with a different preprocessing technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to investigate if conventional ML algorithms can produce high performance when using a different preprocessing technique. For a fair comparison, this project will involve the same dataset as Septiandri's work ([2017](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1707.07129)) which achieved F1 score of 93.19 with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) in the character level and 89.44 with Logistic Regression and 3-character n-grams. While both of my project and the previous study employ character n-grams, my project will take a slightly different approach. The character n-grams will be limited to a word boundary (white space). The word-boundary character n-grams preserve a white space between word-names (e.g., first name and last name) which can be relevant for denoting location of the character sequence. A white space here can inform important information related to, for example, where *na* occurs. N-gram *ko_* occurring at the end of the first name (e.g., *Eko Sulistyo* (M) or *Eka Sulistya* (F)) may have significant discriminatory power in the gender prediction. Furthermore, using this type of character n-gram also allows the model to capture the characteristics of each word separately. This is crucial as different words potentially carry distinct gender connotative meanings, e.g., *na* for feminine name and *no* for masculine one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of character n-grams with word boundary is not only limited to the data representation only but also its high explainability in the model's predictions. Character n-grams allows direct inspection of which fixed combination of characters is most significant in making predictions. For example, finding *na_* in the end of the first name as the most influential feature in female can be easier to communicate how the model reaches its decision. Character LSTM, on the contrary, involves complex process in the modeling, making the model's prediction less transparent and more challenging to explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the predictive modeling approach, a linguistic approach to the names will also be carried out. Exploiting statistical techniques to investigate the male and female names, this analysis provides insights about the male and female names according to linguistic features such as word length, character length, and number of letter vowels and consonants. While these features may not be exhaustive enough, the linguistic features may offer a basis for a further linguistic exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be structured as follows. First, I will perform data exploration, including data preprocessing for a statistical analysis. This statistical analysis will look into the extent to which male and female names based on some linguistic features. Afterwards, predictive modeling will proceed the analysis, focusing on comparing different algorithms to predict gender. "

    "In this section, I aim to understand the dataset before developing a predictive model. The data understanding process will be done by examining data types, number of features, duplicates, class distribution, and missing values. This process will also be supplemented by a statistical data analysis based on features extracted from column `name`. While this inferential statistics does not provide a further understanding on data for the predictive modeling, this analysis will inform whether or not the magnitude of differences in male and female names is statistically significant.\n",

For this reason, I can move on checking whether there are any duplicates in the dataset. Duplicate checking is crucial to get good quality of input data for a machine learning model and a statistical analysis. For predictive modeling, for example, duplicates will be trouble some when they are present in both training and testing sets since the model is tested using the same instance for which it is trained. In a statistical analysis, duplicates will distort variability in the distribution. If appearing multiple times, the variance as the measure of data spread can be low, indicating lower variability. While lower variance is generally preferable, it is not expected when the samples are duplicated. For this reason, insights obtained from dataset containing duplicates is misleading. "

    "**Note**: The duplicates have been removed from the dataset. The data check can be proceeded by calculating the class distribution of gender status. This step  is crucial to understand to what extent the distribution between male and female names is imbalanced. When the distribution is highly uneven, the imbalance class will pose a problem in the machine learning model such as biased predictions to the majority class and lower sensitivity to the minority class. Biased predictions mean that the model more frequently predicts the majority class. And lower sensitivity means that the model is less capable of detecting instances in the minority class. If the class disribution is uneven, resampling, e.g., undersampling (NearMiss) or oversampling (SMOTE or ADASYN), can be used to balance the distribution."

    "- A severe imbalance is usually considered when one class is over 70% of the total sample. However, the distribution of male and female class in the target variable is roughly balanced (55.8 vs 44.2). Consequently, no treatments need to be given to balance the classes.\n",
    "- For the next step, I will check the cleanliness of the column `name` before extracing features from it. The cleanliness check is performed by investigating whether names contain punctuation marks. This process is crucial because in addition to periods, Indonesian names usually contain apostrophes, especialy names with an Arabic origin (parsial or full) such as *Do'a* and *Nu'in* below. The apostrope in Indonesian usually represents the glottal stop or glottal plosive sound.\n",
    "- The punctuation symbols must be removed before extracting character n-grams because the symbols will affect the n-grams, leading to potentially noise in the dataset fed to the model. "

Consonant clusters will be greatly useful when the analysis focuses more on generational differences to see cultural shift. For instance, pre-generation X names, especially from Javanese ethnic, usually use one-word name with small variations in open or closed syllabic constructions (e.g., *mar-gɔ-nɔ* (M) vs *pɔn-i-rah* (F)). And names in gen Z onward at glance tend to be more inclusive of non-native Javanese phonemes, e.g., palato-alveolar sibilant ʃ or alveolar fricative z (as in *mei-ʃa az-zah-ra* (F)), in Javanese society.

    "The objectives of Section 2 is twofold: data preparation, including cleaning, and data analysis. Data preparation serves to investigate the cleanliness of the dataset and handle some problems which are crucial for the modeling process, particularly duplicates. Data analysis is more an quantitative linguistic exploration on the names by considering number of words (names separated by white spaces), number of characters, number of vowels and consonants. While this section does not inform anything to the modeling process, the short linguistic analysis provides an added value of names in gaining an understanding. In addition, based on the series of statistical tests on the difference across gender statuses, the differences in names based on limited linguistic features practically do not matter much. "

    "## **3 Predictive Modeling**\n",
    "This section involves a predictive modeling technique to guess whether someone's gender is male or female based on their full name. As informed by the previous section, some data-related problems, especially for dplicates, have been handled so the next step can directly be done here. Other than duplicates, the dataset contains punctuation marks which require explicit handling in the modeling process. Previously, even though punctuation removal has been done for an analysis purpose, this text cleaning step must be done again in the modeling process. The reason is because earlier, the punctuation removal was performed on different dataset (copy of the dataset) for a different purpose. Additionally, this text cleaning process should be put in the machine learning model to streamline the whole machine learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 3 is outlined as follows. Before moving on to the modeling process, ML data preparations will be carried out. This process includes creation of a text cleaning object which later will be assembled in the ML pipeline. Data splitting and pipeline creation, including putting the different algorithms, are also covered here. Second, after the data is ready for being fed to the algorithms, I will compare different models based on several performance metrics, namely F1, recall, precision, and ROC-AUC, for performance evaluation (explained below). Based on this comparison, three top models will be chosen and tested against testing data. The best model will be tuned and selected as the final model.\n",
    "- F1 (also called F-measure): a model evaluation technique which takes both precision and recall into account equally (harmonic mean, no weighing). \n",

    "\\text{F1 score} = \\frac{2\\times \\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Precision: proportion of predicted positive. For this reason, the formula only involves positive instance categories. \n",
    "    - Just for the record, true positive (TP) in the formula means the model's prediction is positive, and the actual is also positive. For example, a model predict someone's gender Male (alias 1, hereby \"positive\") and the actual gender is also (Male).\n",
    "    - True negative is when both model prediction and the actual instances are negative. For example, the model predicts someone's gender Female (alias 0, hereby \"negative\").\n",
    "    - False positive is when the model's prediction is positive (Male) while actually negative (Female).\n",
    "    - False negative refers to a condition when the prediction is negative (Female) but actually the gender is positive (Male).\n",
    "    - Here, positive and negative have nothing to do with good or bad. These are common terms used to denote types of model's predictions for simplicity.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "- ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve): model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these four evaluation metrics are all useful, the main evaluation metric to assess the performance of a model is F1. It provides a balanced measure incorating different errors (false positives and false negatives). Unlike precision and recall which measure performance in isolation, F1 offers a single metric that reflects overall effectiveness. Additionally, while ROC-AUC offers insights into model discrimination ability, it does not capture the trade off between precision and recall. Therefore, F1 provides a more relevant evaluation metric.\n",

Tuning a model is expected to find an optimal combination of hyperparameters (predefined argument values) which in result can improve the model's performance. The combination is searched by using grid search technique (`GridSearchCV`). Unlike random search technique in hyperparameter tuning, grid search searches best combination of pre-defined hyperparameters for a model or estimator *exhaustively*. It seeks over every possible combination of hyperparamters and find the best combination."

    "#### **3.4.3 Learning Curve**\n",
    "Learning curve is a visual evaluation technique to investigate how the model will perform once the training size increases. By doing this visual inspection, an overfitting problem can be detected. This overfitting problem can be seen by the large difference between the model's performance scores in training and cross-valdiation sets. Visually, when the gap between the lines of a training and cross-validation score (e.g., F1, recall, precision, or ROC-AUC), is narrow, the model is less likely to suffer from the overfitting problem. To note, overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training set but does not perform equally well or better in the testing set. When the overfitting problem occurs, the model does not generalize its learning to the new data.\n",

    "To more accurately explaining the learning curve, I also provide the numerical output of the model's learning process."

    "**Note**: The four learning curves above examine how the same model is evaluated using four performance metrics when the training data increases. In all curves, the model shows excellent performance: The gaps between training (<span style='color:red'>red line</span>) and cross-validation score lines (<span style='color:green'>green</span>) are narrow. For instance, the training mean score in ROC-AUC initially starts at 1.00 with the testing mean score of 0.90. The mean difference when the training size is around 100 instances is 0.092, and the mean difference is getting smaller once the training size is added. The narrow gap here suggests that the issue of overfitting does not occur in the model."

What I mean by actual outcome here is the fraction of positives. An ideal model is that with a diagonal line from the bottom left corner to the top right corner, suggesting a perfectly reliable model. For example, when the model predicts the probability of a name as male is 0.70, the actual probability is also 0.70.\n",

In short, Brier score informs the overall quality of probabilistic predictions. A lower score after calibration means better reliability in the predictions. And ECE shows the mean difference between pred probabilities and actual outcomes. Similar to Brier score, a lower score, closer to 0, is desirable in this evaluation, meaning calibration process gives a better effect on the model.\n",

The overconfidence can be seen from the red line which is located below the diagonal line: The model's predicteed probability is higher than it should be. For example, when the model's predict a name as male (class 1) with predicted probability of 0.18, the actual probability is 0. Judging solely from this calibration curve, the model must be calibrated to increase the reliability of the model's prediction but before doing the calibration, I will look into the Brier score and the expected calibration error."

For example, in the linear SVM, coefficient is derived from the model coefficient directly and this XAI method is only applicable to linear models, including SVM with linear kernel. Permutation importance, on the other hand, is calculated by measuring the change in model performance after shuffling a fature. Unlike coefficient feature importance limited to specific models, permutation importance is applicable to any models (model agnostic approach)."

    "- The output above shows similar output with the confusion matrix shown earlier but here I also display the misprediction rate along with specific entries in which the model makes mistakes in its predictions. In brief, the rate of mispredictions is small ($\\approx$ 6% of the testing set). In addition to this, based on the bar chart, group 0 and group 3 have the highest number of misclassifications. The difference is while the misclassifications in group 0 are false neegatives (actual male but predicted as female), group 3 consists of 9 false positives (actual femalee but predicted as male). To this point, I need to check the descriptive statistics of the predicted probabilities in both groups.\n",
    "- In the dataframe below, let us consider column `ProbM` (probability of instance being male) errors in Group 0 happen when the predicted probability range is closer to 0 (Female) than to 1 (Male), resulting the model's decision to consider the name female. For this reason, the errors are false negatives.\n",
    "- In group 3, false positives are mostly situated in. The misclassifications occur when the predicted probabilities are closer to 1 (male) than to 0 (female). As a result, the model incorrectly consider some instances to be male when they should be female."

As shown below, while there are some first or middle names ending with *na_*, the majority of instances are female. The higher frequency of names associated with female than male could be the main reason for such error.\n",
    "- Third, *mulyana* was also incorrectly predicted as female. The model's decision is based on the n-gram *yan* wihch has negative coefficient, and hence, dragging the prediction to female."

    "## **4 Conclusions and Future Directions**\n",
    "In brief, this project aims to analyze difference between male and female names in a quantitative linguistic perspective and build a classifier to predict gender based on full names, especially using word-boundary charcter n-grams. \n",
    "- **Statistical analysis on linguistic features**: Based on the analysis on male and female names in terms of word count, character count, letter vowel count, and letter consonant count, it was found that male and female names are only significantly different in terms of letter vowel and consonant counts only.  However, the effect sizes for these differences were very small, suggesting that while statistically significant, the practical impact of these differences is minimal. The practical impact means that these variables alone do not contribute significantly to understanding gender according to names.\n",
    "- **Predictive analysis**: An experiment involving different models suggest that Support Vector Machine with linear kernel function is the best performing model with F1 score of 0.94 in testing data. For comparison, the previous study achieved F1 score of 0.89 with Logistic Regression (3-character n-grams) and 0.93 with char-LSTM. Based on the F1 scores, word-boundary character n-grams with a conventional ML algorithm can lead to slightly higher performance than character Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). \n",
    "\n",
    "For future development, below I outline several points.\n",
    "- The sample size in this project is small (*N* = 1,796). While adding more samples may not increase effect size in the group difference tests, increasing sample size may improve the statistical power and the model's performance. For a statistical test, increasing sample size can prevent the analysis from failing to detect an effect that actually exists. For the predictive modeling, adding more samples can help the model improve its performance since the model learns more the patterns of male and female names.\n",
    "- While word-boundary character n-grams can capture the surface structure of character sequence in names, this type of n-gram do not capture gender-specific connotations based on sociolinguistic knowledge. For example, *no* occurring at the end of the name, especially in Javanese society, e.g., *Sumarno*, *Margono*, and *Sugiyanto*, are usually associated with male (masculine names). Word-boundary character n-grams may also not be generalizable well for names which do not share common n-gram patterns. Alternate spellings, e.g. *Diva* vs *Difa*, may also be considered different n-grams when they are ponologically the same in Indonesian. For context, *Diva* and *Difa* are pronounced the same in bahasa Indonesia since this language does not distinguish sound *f* and *v*. For these two reasons, character embedding trained on a large corpus of names can be an alternative approach to the predictive modeling."
